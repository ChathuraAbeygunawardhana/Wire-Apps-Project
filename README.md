## Technologies Used

### Expo

I used Expo because it's easy to implement and the development process is faster.

### Redux

I used Redux for state management because it provides a predictable state container, making it easier to manage and debug the application state.

### TailwindCSS - NativeWind

I used TailwindCSS - NativeWind for this project to leverage utility-first CSS for styling, which speeds up the development process and ensures a consistent design.
